# MATLAB CNN Model Description
Convolution Neural Network for the Cifar10 data set. All functions were made from scratch. This later be paired with the pytorch version to compare accuracy. This model breaks down the funciton to
show how the model through the data set to predict a ouput. The neural network has updating weights and biases, but the kernals and the filter biases are not updated. This is due to hardware
processing restriciton that don't have enough processing power to optimize the filters.
